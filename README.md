# Handwritten Digits Recognition

This project is a handwritten digit recognition model developed using Python and the MNIST dataset. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) and TensorFlow framework for training.

## Dataset

The [MNIST dataset](https://github.com/micahkepe/handwritten_digits_recognition) is used for training and evaluating the model. It consists of a large number of labeled handwritten digit images, with each image being a 28x28 grayscale picture. The dataset is widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.

## Model Architecture

The handwritten digit recognition model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) for its high performance in image-related tasks. CNNs are particularly effective at capturing spatial hierarchies and patterns within images.

The architecture of the model consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers for downsampling and reducing dimensionality. This is followed by fully connected layers to learn high-level representations of the input data. Finally, a softmax layer is used for multi-class classification.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

- Python: The programming language used for developing the model.
- TensorFlow: The deep learning framework utilized for building and training the model.
- MNIST dataset: The dataset employed for training and evaluating the model.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): The architecture utilized for the handwritten digit recognition model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/micahkepe/handwritten_digits_recognition.git`
2. Download the MNIST dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
5. After training, use the `predict.py` script to make predictions on new handwritten digits.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some possible future enhancements for this project:

- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
- Explore different CNN architectures or hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model further.
- Extend the model to handle other digit recognition tasks or even broader image recognition tasks.
